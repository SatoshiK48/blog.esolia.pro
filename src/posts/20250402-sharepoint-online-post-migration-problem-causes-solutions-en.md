Are you facing issues where files won't open **after migrating to SharePoint Online?** In this article, we explain the differences in SPO's folder structure, URL limitations, access management, and _give some practical troubleshooting solutions_. We also provide a detailed guide on metadata management to enhance searchability!

## From On-Premises to the Cloud 

> Decommission all on-premises servers across all sites and move to the cloud!

This is a common scenario in foreign-affiliated companies. Often, projects are rolled out to local offices under directives from Global IT. In one such company, following an order from the Global IT Manager, the local IT team was tasked with reviewing its file server operations and migrating them to the cloud.

As a result, **SharePoint Online (SPO)** was introduced.

Migrating from an on-premises file server to SPO offers potential benefits such as cost reduction, improved operational efficiency, and enhanced security. However, because it operates differently from traditional file servers, hidden challenges often emerge.

This was not just a simple server migration—it was a major shift that required changes in operations and processes.

## Concerns Become Reality
The migration was successfully completed. However, the local IT team had lingering concerns:
**"Is this really going to work? Will end users be able to adapt?"** <br>

Their fears soon materialized as users began reporting issues: 
**"An error appears, and I can’t access my files!"** 

What exactly was the problem? Let’s break it down.

## SPO Limitations and Workplace Confusion 
With a strict deadline in place and limited time for careful implementation, the team aimed to minimize disruption by maintaining the existing operational approach as much as possible.

**・Access permissions were set per folder**
**・The same folder structure from the file server was carried over**  
However, SPO is fundamentally different from on-premises file servers in its design. As a result, retaining the old folder structure led to frequent errors where files could not be opened.But why?

**Root Cause: Folder Structure Was Too Deep, Exceeding Character Limits**<br> 

Many companies manage their files with deeply nested folder structures, categorizing files by year, client, and other attributes within multiple subfolders. 
However, in SPO, this approach leads to issues such as: 
"Files won’t open due to path length limitations!"  
To better understand the issue, let's examine SPO’s unique characteristics and the constraints it imposes.

## SharePoint Online Constraints 
**1. Folder Structure Limitations**<br>
・Deep folder structures are not recommended in SPO.
・Instead, a metadata-driven approach should be used for better searchability.

**2. File Path Length Restrictions**<br>
・When syncing files to a local PC and opening them via Windows Explorer, the path is limited to 256 characters.
・Even if a file opens in SPO, it may fail to open on a local PC if the path exceeds this limit.

&nbsp;**OneDrive Sync Client:** 
&nbsp;&nbsp;When accessing synced files from Windows Explorer, the 256-character limit applies.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the folder structure is too deep, files may not open unless the path is shortened.<br>
&nbsp;**Browser Access:** 
&nbsp;&nbsp;If files are opened directly from the SharePoint Web interface, the local PC limit does not apply.
&nbsp;&nbsp;However, SharePoint itself has a URL length limit of 400 characters. 

**3. Leveraging Search Features**<br>
・Instead of relying on deep folder structures, users can utilize metadata management and search functionality to find files more efficiently.
 
Since SPO follows a different architectural approach than traditional file servers, it cannot be used in the same way. A new operational strategy aligned with SPO’s capabilities is necessary. 

**How Can We Avoid These Issues and Use SPO Efficiently?**

## Solutions

* **Utilize metadata management** instead of hierarchical folder structures,<br> categorizing files using "columns.<br>
*  **Split document libraries by use case,** keeping folder structures as **simple as possible.**<br>
* **Leverage search functionality** to locate files without opening folders.<br>
* **Use shorter filenames** to prevent path length issues.<br>
* **Establish a naming convention** for consistency (e.g., **"ProjectName_Date_Version"**).<br>

## Summary 
SPO migration projects don’t end with migration completion—they require ongoing adaptation to a more suitable operational model. By understanding SPO’s characteristics and establishing operational rules, companies can maximize the benefits of the cloud. 
"At first, it was confusing, but after using the search feature, I realized it made my work much easier!" To ensure more users share this sentiment, it’s essential to review operations and implement the right measures. 

**Next: Practical Metadata Management**<br>
In Part 2, we’ll explore how to effectively manage metadata as an alternative to deep folder structures. This will help improve searchability and ensure smooth operations in SPO.<br>
